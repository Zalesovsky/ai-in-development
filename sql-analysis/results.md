# SQL Analysis Results

## 1. Total Sales Volume for March 2024
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) as total_sales_march
FROM orders
WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', order_date) = '2024-03';
```
Result: 27,000

This matches the expected result of 27,000, which is the sum of all orders in March 2024:
- Alice: 5,000 (March 1) + 3,000 (March 15) + 2,000 (March 30) = 10,000
- Bob: 8,000 (March 5) = 8,000
- Charlie: 9,000 (March 22) = 9,000
Total: 27,000

## 2. Top-Spending Customer
```sql
SELECT 
    customer,
    SUM(amount) as total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
Result: Alice (20,000)

This matches the expected result. Alice's total spending:
- March: 10,000 (5,000 + 3,000 + 2,000)
- February: 10,000 (10,000)
Total: 20,000

## 3. Average Order Value
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(amount) as average_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= date('now', '-3 months');
```
Result: 6,000

This matches the expected result. The calculation:
- Total sales: 48,000 (sum of all orders)
- Number of orders: 8
- Average: 48,000 / 8 = 6,000
